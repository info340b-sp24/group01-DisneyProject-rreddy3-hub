# INFO 340 Project: 

UW Crave This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. For this project, we've developed a food-recommendation app specifically tailored to UW students. Unlike Yelp, which recommends food and other services outside of U-District, we've developed an app that limits the scope to U-District food and beverage businesses to make the app more accessible to UW Seattle students. 

Students must first log in using their google accounts in order to access our app's features (such as adding and favoriting a meal).

One of the features is that users can upload their favorite meals to the platform, specifying the item name, their rating (out of five stars), and a written review. They also have the option to specify the meal's cuisine type, price point, and the location of the restaurant. 

Another feature is that users can search through the home page of uploaded meals and filter by these features (cuisine, price, and rating). These filters are located at the top of the page on the navbar of the home page.

In addition, another feature is that users can also favorite meals and save them to their favorites list to try later. This is done by clicking on the heart button (the favorites button) of a meal card and the user can route to the favorites list page to see the meal added.

There was an attempt to create a detailed meal page for each review but due to some constraints, our team could not finalize the code. However, it is available in the ‘discarded’ folder within the components folder.

We hope that through this app, the UW community can benefit in a variety of ways. UW Students and staff can bond over their favorite meals, while businesses in the U-District can gain more traction and customer loyalty through the UW community. Share your mealtime faves on UW Crave!
