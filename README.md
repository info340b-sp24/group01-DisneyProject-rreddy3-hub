# INFO 340 Project: UW Crave

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

For this project, we've developed a food-recommendation app specifically tailored to UW students. Unlike Yelp, which recommends food and other services outside of U-District, we've developed an app that limits the scope to U-District food and beverage businesses to make the app more accessible to UW Seattle students. Users can upload their favorite meals to the platform, specifying the item name, their rating (out of five stars), and a written review. They also have the option to specify the meal's cuisine type, price point, and the location of the restaurant. Users can then search through the home page of uploaded meals and filter by these features (cuisine, price, and rating). Users can also favorite meals and save them to their favorites list to try later.

We hope that through this app, the UW community can benefit in a variety of ways. UW Students and staff can bond over their favorite meals, while businesses in the U-District can gain more traction and customer loyalty through the UW community. Share your mealtime faves on UW Crave!
