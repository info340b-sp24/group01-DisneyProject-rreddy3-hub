    <!-- PROBLEM/DATA DOMAIN -->
    <section>
        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Type 1-2 paragraphs giving an overview of the topic/question,
            an information technology problem, and 1 previous/existing 
            attempt to solve the problem here.

            Incoming and current UW students have so many places to choose from when it comes
            to food! However, due to the overwhelming number of restaurants, cafes, and other
            food establishments available off-campus, it is difficult for students to narrow
            their choices down through an internet search alone. While recommendations
            are available through word of mouth or online, it can be quite a challenge to 
            keep track of them without a platform specifically for UW students.

            While apps such as Yelp have attempted to solve this problem, they are usually
            geared towards a more broader range of establishments outside of food such as 
            dentists, beauty salons, and doctors. Because users have to take extra steps to filter
            through these other establishments, it discourages them from finding the perfect place
            to eat. Additionally, it does not specifically cater towards UW students, which can 
            remove the sense of having a community as well.
