    <!-- PROBLEM/DATA DOMAIN -->

        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            Incoming and current UW students have so many places to choose from when it comes
            to food! However, due to the overwhelming number of restaurants, cafes, and other
            food establishments available off-campus, it is difficult for students to narrow
            their choices down through an internet search alone. While recommendations
            are available through word of mouth or online, it can be quite a challenge to 
            keep track of them without a platform specifically for UW students.

            While apps such as Yelp have attempted to solve this problem, they are usually
            geared towards a more broader range of establishments outside of food such as 
            dentists, beauty salons, and doctors. Because users have to take extra steps to filter
            through these other establishments, it discourages them from finding the perfect place
            to eat. Additionally, it does not specifically cater towards UW students, which can 
            remove the sense of having a community as well.

        <h2>Solution/Web App Description</h2>
        <p>
            As a solution to this problem, we would like to build a U-District centered food recommendation app specifically for UW students. 
            However, considering the fact that this app is centered around UW, it may naturally exclude non-students living around U-district. 
            Additionally, the app could exacerbate disparities between local restaurants due to the user-based recommendation system. 
            For example, many students might endorse already popular restaurants such as Aladdin’s Gyro-Cery and Cafe on the Ave, but less-popular 
            restaurants may not get as much exposure and could affect businesses disproportionately. Additionally, this app may not be useful for 
            students who cannot afford to eat out or who do not live in the U-district. Despite some of these limitations, we aim to strengthen 
            the UW community by implementing features that can help combat these challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first feature we propose for our app is a user-upload feature, where students can upload their favorite meal, the restaurant it came from, 
            the cuisine type, the price range, and a description of why they enjoy this meal. For example, a user can upload “Aladdin Fries” as their 
            favorite meal from <a href="https://www.aladdingyro.com/menu">"Aladdin's Gyro-Cery”</a>, which is a Mediterranean cuisine and costs $10.90. 
            They can then caption this recommendation with, “The best fries on the Ave!”.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second feature we propose is a filtering and searching feature where students can search for specific meals, restaurants, or cuisines 
            and get filtered results based on these search terms. We also plan to implement a filtering option where students can filter out certain 
            price ranges ($-$$$$) and cuisines so that searches are more refined and efficient. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The last small feature we propose is a “save list” feature where students can save recommendations to a list of meals and restaurants they want to try. 
            This allows students to curate a list of restaurants they can try in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users will primarily be viewing restaurant recommendations provided by other users, similar to <a href="https://www.yelp.com">"Yelp”</a>. The recommendations will include information such as restaurant names, cuisine types, and addresses. 
            The food recommendation app allows users to contribute to a crowdsourced dataset by uploading pictures of their dining experiences to share with the community. 
            The app serves as a solution to the problem of deciding where to eat near the UW campus. 
            It provides users with personalized and reliable recommendations.
